## Theme
We chose to pursue the idea of "nearby in space, but distant in time" by having an older version of the character revisit his childhood home and rediscover his memories as a child. So the character is physically near the space but the events that he's examining happened a long time ago. 


## Selectable requirements
### Data-driven experience
- Taking data from a separate file and using it to create graphics on the screen. We are using a .json file and a source png to create our tilemap world. 
### Procedural graphics
- Going to make a game logo out of basic shapes like rectangles, circles etc.. 
### Networking
- Storing player data in a separate file are stored in a small server. So that we can take those stats and display them later at the end of game.



[contributorCredits] The documentation identifies all of the direct contributors to the code and their assigned roles (e.g. "testing lead")
[asset credits] If the team has built there game using assets created by anyone else (even if those assets were modified before inclusion in the game), the upstream source of those assets should be credited in the documentation as well.
