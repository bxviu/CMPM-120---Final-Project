## Theme
We chose to pursue the idea of "nearby in space, but distant in time" by having an older version of the character revisit his childhood home and rediscover his memories as a child. So the character is physically near the space but the events that he's examining happened a long time ago. He goes back 3 times, each time either re-examining objects he's seen before, or finding new objects to reminisce about.


## Selectable requirements
### Data-driven experience
- Taking data from a separate file and using it to create graphics on the screen. We are using a .json file and a source png to create our tilemap world. 
- "itemInfo.json" in the data folder
- "Getting_Old_Tilemap_large_v1.1.1.json" also in data folder
### Procedural graphics
- Going to make a game logo out of basic shapes like rectangles, circles etc.. 
### Networking
- Storing player statistics in a json file hosted on Glitch.com. If the player reaches the end of the last level, their statistics are uploaded to the server and is each statistic is added to a corresponding global count
