Scene Flow Prototype Requirements: 
Scene Types 
- We have Main title screen, 
- a cinematic scene introducing backstory
- the gameplay scene
- transitions
- A stat screen that displays things the player did so unique for each person
- Ending Scene 
- Credit Scene
Communication between scenes: 
- Transitions we have one called 20 years later and one 40 years later we do this by including a global variable 
- Also the stat screen (not implemented yet) will take global variable of the player and display it
Reachability:
- Our game doesn't have a win or lose so you can reach everything just my clicking around. 
Transitions: 
- Scenes fade to black when you get to new scene.
