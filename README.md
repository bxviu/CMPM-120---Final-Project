We chose to pursue the idea of "nearby in space, but distant in time" by having an older version of the character revisit his childhood home and rediscover his memories as a child. So the character is physically near the space but the events that he's examining happened a long time ago. 


[selectableRequirements] The documentation describes which of the three selectable requirements your team is attempting to satisfy (see below).


[contributorCredits] The documentation identifies all of the direct contributors to the code and their assigned roles (e.g. "testing lead")
[asset credits] If the team has built there game using assets created by anyone else (even if those assets were modified before inclusion in the game), the upstream source of those assets should be credited in the documentation as well.
